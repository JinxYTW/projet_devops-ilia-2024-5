# School Microblogging Platform (Twitter-like)

## üìå Project Overview
This academic project aimed to **recreate a Twitter-like social network within the school**.  
The main goal was to implement an **open-source collaboration workflow** involving more than **30 students**, each responsible for different features of the platform.  

Even though the project was not fully completed due to time constraints, the exercise successfully demonstrated the application of **DevOps methodologies** in a team setting.

## üìÇ Project Structure
The project includes several technologies and components:  

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Cloud/Infrastructure**: Kubernetes for deployment simulation  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts for hosting simulation  
- **Collaboration**: Git-based workflow with multiple teams working concurrently on different features  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose
The main objectives of the project were:  
1. Practice **collaborative software development** in a large team  
2. Apply **DevOps principles**, including CI/CD, containerization, and infrastructure management  
3. Gain experience in **cloud orchestration** and **infrastructure automation**  

## üë§ Contributors
The project was developed by a team of **30+ students** at the school, divided into feature-based groups.  

## üìñ Notes
- The project is **not fully functional**, but it served as a practical exercise in **team collaboration, DevOps, and cloud simulation**.  
- Code includes multiple **HTML/CSS pages**, **Kubernetes manifests**, and **Terraform scripts** for infrastructure simulation.
